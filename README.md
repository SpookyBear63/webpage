# webpage
This is a single webpage I created to help people understand the equation y = mx + b. I had trouple with makeing the interactive graphs, something I have never done before, but I made a drag and drop to make an interactive plotting graph. All of the images are my own including the logo. You will not find these images anywhere on the internet. I made hide/show tags for the information to make it easy for the information to be understood.
It has been a while since I have made a webpage. I feel like this is some of my best work. I hope everyone sees the beauty in it like I do.
